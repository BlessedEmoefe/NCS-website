  <p> and the lord appered unto him in the palins of mamre:and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
    and he lifts up his eyes and looked,and,lo,three men stood by him;and when he saw them he went to meet them,from the tent door,amd bowed himself toowarde the ground,and said,my lord,in i have found favour in thy sight ,pass not away,i pray thee,from thy servants:
    let a little water,i pray you ,be fetched,and wash your feet,and rest yourselves under the tree:
    and i will fetch a mossle of bread,and comfort ye your hearts:after that yre shall pass on:for therefore are ye come out to thy .and theysaid ,so do,as thou hast said'
    and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah,and said,make ready quickly three measures of fine meal,knead it,and make cake upon the hearth.
    and abraham rean unto the herd,and fetch a calf tender and good,gave it unto a young man;and he hastened to dress it.
    and he took butter and milk,and the calf which he had dressed ,and set it before them;and he stood by them under the tree,and they did eat it.
    and they said unto him,where is sarah thy wife?and he said ,behold,in the tent.
    and he said,i iwll certainly return unto the according to the time of life;and,lo,satrah thy wife shall have a son.and sarah heard it in the tent door,which was behind him.
    now abraham and sarah wrere old and well stricken in age;and it ceased to be that sarah after the manner of women.
    therefore sarah laughed within herself,saying ,after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure,my lord being old also?
    and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh,saying,shall i of a shorty bear a child,which am old?
    is any thing too hard for the lord?at the time appointed i will return unto thee,according to thy time of life,and sarah shall have a son.
    then sarah denied saying, i laughed not;for she was afraid,and he said,nay,but htou didst laugh.
    and the men rose up frpm thence,and looked into sodom:and abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
    and the lord said,shall i hade unto abraham that thing which i do;
    seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation,and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
    for i know him,that he will command his children and his household after him,and they shall keep the way of the lord,to do justice and judgement;that the lord ,may bring upon abraham that which he had spoken of him
    and the lord said,because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great,and because their sin is very greivous;
    i will go down now,and see whether they have done altogether accoording to the cry of it,which is come unto me,and if not,i will know
