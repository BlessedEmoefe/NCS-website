# NCS-website
This was my first html and css clone project. As a beginner learning how to code, I cloned the Nigerian Custom Service website in 2019.

## After the Project
It was a wonderful experience building this for the first time a long time ago .
It taught me that I could build anything if only i dedicated the time and effort to doing so.
